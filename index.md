<div style="text-align: justify">Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) is a numerical method used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe electromagnetic wave propagation. It is a time-domain approach that discretizes both space and time, representing the fields at each point on a grid and advancing the solution through time using iterative calculations. I have implemented a Python-based Finite Element Method to solve the Laplace equation in a square domain with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions (the boundary values on each side of the domain zero) using matrix methods.</div>
