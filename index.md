<div style="text-align: justify">This project utilized the Home Credit Default Risk dataset to develop a machine learning-based model for predicting default risk, with imbalanced target data (91.93% TARGET=0 and 8.07% TARGET=1). After imputing missing values, applying one-hot encoding, and creating features such as CREDIT_INCOME_PERCENT and DAYS_EMPLOYED_PERCENT, the Random Forest Classifier model achieved an accuracy of 87% and an AUC-ROC of 0.77.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">I performed comprehensive EDA to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers, performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict house prices. My best model had Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12293.919, ranking <b>95/15502</b>, approximately <b>top 0.6%</b> in the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project I am going to perform comprehensive EDA on the breast cancer dataset, then transform the data using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and use Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether a patient has breast cancer.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) is a numerical method used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe electromagnetic wave propagation. It is a time-domain approach that discretizes both space and time, representing the fields at each point on a grid and advancing the solution through time using iterative calculations. I have implemented a Python-based Finite Element Method to solve the Laplace equation in a square domain with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions (the boundary values on each side of the domain zero) using matrix methods.</div>
