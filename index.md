<div style="text-align: justify">Through an in-depth analysis of churned customer data, we successfully identified the profiles of customers more likely to leave the service, the key factors influencing churn decisions, and also the critical moments when customers are most likely to discontinue their subscriptions. These findings can be leveraged to develop more effective retention strategies.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">This project utilized the Home Credit Default Risk dataset to develop a machine learning-based model for predicting default risk, with imbalanced target data (91.93% vs 8.07%). After imputing missing values, applying one-hot encoding, and creating features, the Random Forest Classifier (RFC) model achieved 87% accuracy and 0.77 AUC-ROC.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Through this project, we developed a Random Forest-based predictive model that accurately projects global COVID-19 case trends using a data-driven approach. The model was evaluated using metrics RMSE and MAE, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting the number of new cases while identifying regions with potential case surges.</div>

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/ferryatm/finite-difference-time-domain)

<div style="text-align: justify">Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) is a numerical method used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe electromagnetic wave propagation. It is a time-domain approach that discretizes both space and time, representing the fields at each point on a grid and advancing the solution through time using iterative calculations. I have implemented a Python-based Finite Element Method to solve the Laplace equation in a square domain with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions (the boundary values on each side of the domain zero) using matrix methods.</div>
